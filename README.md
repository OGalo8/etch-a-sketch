The project consists in creating an interactive grid that has a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

The grid has been created and the coloring happens on-hover. 

Now I want to create a color restart button, and add a color selector and a grid-size interactive bar.
To restart, add an event listener to the restart button that sets the color of the container (or each .col element) to the original one.

After the beforementioned is done, I will add a randomizer for the color, and a progressive darkening effect where each interaction darkens the square by 10%. The goal is to achieve a fully black (or completely colored) square in only ten interactions. (using the opacity property in CSS).
